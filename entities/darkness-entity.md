**First Referenced:**

The Portal in the Forest (Part 1)

**Other references:**

The Portal in the Forest (Part 6)

Not to be confused with [The Ink](/unknown/the-ink/), a phenomenon encountered by [Higgins](/people/higgins/).

First encountered by [Cristina Thompson](/people/cristina-thompson/) indirectly via the [Soul Reader (Book)](/devices/soul-reader-book/) found in the same reality. The Darkness entity rapidly disintegrates any biological matter that falls within the beam of the light source it currently inhabits.

**Traits:**

- Requires an available light source to survive/exist, and is capable of jumping between light sources no sooner than 45 seconds after the previous jump
- Displays at least semi-intelligent behavior through hunting for victims
- Extremely dangerous when large light sources are available, and capable of ending an entire planet by jumping to the sun (covering the entire sun-ward facing side of the planet)
