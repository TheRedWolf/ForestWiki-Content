Green Titans are constructed lifeforms, hundreds of feet tall and built out of plant matter. Created by the [Cordyceps Fungus](/entities/cordyceps-fungus) plant god, they are anticipated to be an engineered weapon, similar to the [Sniper Plant Pods](/entities/sniper-plant-pod) and [Facehugging Plant Pods](/entities/facehugging-plant-pod).

Little else is known of the nature, construction or abilities of the Green Titans.
