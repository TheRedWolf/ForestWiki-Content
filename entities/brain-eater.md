First witnessed as attacking a parallel Earth where [Heath](/people/heath/) spent eleven hours disarming a global nuclear strike triggered in response to their presence, the brain-eaters were also witnessed on [Noah Fulmer](/people/noah-fulmer/)'s Earth attacking a large hulking entity in the distance.

**Traits:**

- Capable of rapid defensive evolution against attacks
- Likes to spear biological life in the skull, and take up residence within (the effect on the victim is unknown)
