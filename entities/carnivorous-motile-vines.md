# Carnivorous Motile Vines

**First Referenced:**

'I was told that everyone I'd served with in the military died shortly after I left. (Part 7)'

The Carnivorous Motile Vines are a species of highly mobile plant which derives nutrients from victims that are digested in highly corrosive purple liquid pools, secreted by the vines. The vines are non-sentient, but are capable of sensing and reacting rapidly to any movement within their vicinity.

Any object detected and successfully ensnared by the vines is promptly pulled to a digestion pool, where a corrosive purple liquid rapidly dissolves organic material. During the destruction of [The First World](/worlds/the-first-world/), a section of city became infested with Carnivorous Motile Vines, which rapidly captured any human survivors, along with many other creatures and entities (such as [Facehugging Plant Pods](/entities/facehugging-plant-pod/)) unleashed on The First World from [Teskoy Prison](/devices/teskoy-prison/) or from other dangerous realities.

**Traits:**

- Readily identified by their four inch thick vines and large leaves
- Highly mobile, capable of capturing various life forms for digestion in acidic pools
- Does not seem to favor any specific type of prey - plant or animal
- Destructibility unknown, but can be sufficiently satiated (through feeding) to allow escape if trapped
