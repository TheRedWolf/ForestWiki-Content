# Carnivorous Simulacrum

**First Referenced:**

'I was told that everyone I'd served with in the military died shortly after I left. (Part 7)'

The Carnivorous Simulacrum is an entity that hides behind a visual illusion in order to trap and consume unwary prey. During brief moments the simulation has been known to fail, in which an observer can see yellowish flesh, covered with spiked, gnashing mouths.

**Traits:**

- Carnivorous, uses visual illusion to disguise itself to match its surroundings
- Intelligence levels unknown, but demonstrated that the illusions are limited by its inability to mimic the surrounding devastation of [The First World](/worlds/the-first-world/)
