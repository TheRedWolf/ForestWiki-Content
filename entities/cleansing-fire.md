First encountered by the children working with [Cristina Thompson](/people/cristina-thompson) in a failed attempt to dispose of the [Soul Reader (Book)](/devices/soul-reader-book) through an unstable portal. Due to portal instabilities, the children were able to cross from their world, but unable to return via the same path. The children were later rescued by [Cristina Thompson](/people/cristina-thompson), who directed them at a punishing pace to a secondary portal located 4.9 miles line-of-sight from the primary portal.

**Traits:**
- The Cleansing Fire is a technological construct, consisting of multiple orbital mirror satellites that focus and direct solar energy to create a continuous high temperature curtain of fire across the planet
- The scorched surface of the planet has an obsidian finish, with surface temperatures climbing to at least 1274 degrees K while being cleansed
- Appears to circle the planet at approximately four miles per hour, although this would likely differ depending on geographic location, configuration of the orbital stations, and any residual temporal effects from the [Temporal Bacteria](/entities/temporal-bacteria)
