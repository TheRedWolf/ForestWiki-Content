Jelly-biters are a type of flat, gelatinous creature that feeds on a variety of materials such as bacteria and shards of metal. They exist within [Teskoy Prison](/devices/teskoy-prison), where they are used to dress major wounds. They are flat, and have a large number of probing feelers with which they gather nutrition.

**Traits:**
- Non-sentient
- Useful for cleaning wounds
- Potentially dangerous given their existence within Teskoy Prison
