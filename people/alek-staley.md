## Early History

Alek (short for Alexander) Staley lived in the universe originally inhabited by the [Dreamer On High](/entities/dreamer-on-high), outside the [Outer Shield](/entities/outer-shield). He had a brother, Will, and has a sister, Laura. Diagnosed with a mental disorder which causes difficulty in distinguishing the difference between reality and dreams, for which he originally took medication. Subsequent exposure to the [Dreamer On High](/entities/dreamer-on-high) has since induced a permanent change which has rectified the disorder. Described as grubby and unshaven, as well as a fan of heavy metal such as Megadeth and Dio.

Alek encountered the [Brownshirts](/entities/brownshirt) after their exodus from their universe, which was consumed by Von Neumann machines, and assisted in freeing a number of them from the [Dreamer On High](/entities/dreamer-on-high). The [Brownshirts](/entities/brownshirt) gave Alek a small [Metallic Chip](/devices/metallic-chip) which shows a way to a safe haven, similar to that retrieved by [Cristina Thompson](/people/cristina-thompson) on the parallel Earth controlled by the [Cordyceps Fungus](/entities/cordyceps-fungus).

## Recent History

Alek has since teamed up with [Danny](/people/danny), [Thomas](/people/thomas) and the other members of their group in an effort to fight [The Crushing Fist](/entities/the-crushing-fist). He has become part of [The Council](/entities/the-council), the de facto leadership of the vast number of refugees that flooded inwards towards [The First World](/worlds/the-first-world), prior to its destruction. Alek has also become something of a hero to many refugees, who revere him for his actions against the [Dreamer On High](/entities/dreamer-on-high) and leading people towards [The First World](/worlds/the-first-world) away from danger.

Alek has since commenced a mission to an 'Amber' world, or [Branch World](/worlds/branch-world). The shield cracks were accessed via [Earth 44](/worlds/earth-44), however the [Mictlan](/entities/corpse-thing/) have already arrived in that world. Alek and his volunteers do not expect to survive their attempt to negotiate with the [Mictlan](/entities/corpse-thing/), and Alek has passed a presumed final message to [Ashley](/people/ashley) via [Heath](/people/heath), as well as instructions to let his sister die peacefully should he also not survive.

**Traits:**
- Varied, in part due to the effects of the [Dreamer On High](/entities/dreamer-on-high). Since having his mental state cleared through the effects of the [Dreamer On High](/entities/dreamer-on-high), his personality could be described as introverted but caring.
