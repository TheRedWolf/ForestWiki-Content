N/A - Appears in some capacity in many stories featuring [Noah Fulmer](/people/noah-fulmer)

Chris is a childhood friend of [Noah Fulmer](/people/noah-fulmer) and [Caitlin](/people/caitlin), and participated in (albeit to an extent unwillingly) many of the supernatural experiences with them in their early years.

Chris later began dating [Caitlin](/people/caitlin), and encountered two more unusual phenomenon with her as well as [Noah Fulmer](/people/noah-fulmer). One event resulted in their translocation from Ohio to Western Virginia, while the other with the [Quantum Duplication Rift/cleft](/devices/quantum-duplication-rift-cleft) resulted in the production of an exact doppelganger who was left captured by a carnivorous entity along with the duplicates of [Caitlin](/people/caitlin) and [Noah Fulmer](/people/noah-fulmer). The status of Chris' doppelganger remains unknown.

Chris joined the global evacuation of his world, due to the damage wrought by the detonation of a [Dimensional Fracture Bomb](/devices/dimensional-fracture-bomb) in the nearby reality of [Jonathan Cortin](/people/jonathan-cortin), eventually meeting with [Noah Fulmer](/people/noah-fulmer) on a [Farming World](/worlds/farming-world), prior to his joining in [The Battle of the Capital Temple](/timelines/chronology-of-events-the-battle-of-the-capital-temple).

**Traits:** Described as having brown hair and eyes, with hard cheeks. Prefers to avoid the supernatural, tagging along with [Noah Fulmer](/people/noah-fulmer) out of friendship. Holds a slight grudge against [Noah Fulmer](/people/noah-fulmer) for exposing him to so many horrific experiences, in part believing him to attract or cause the events.
