The Fountain of Youth (Part 2)

Hugh is a friend of [Ward Shaw (The Sword)](/people/ward-shaw-the-sword), apparently well educated in history and science as well as being able to undertake scientific analysis of various forms of sampled material. While his physical characteristics are not clearly defined, he originally has myopia for which he wears glasses, which is subsequently corrected through exposure to the [Regeneration Core](/entities/regeneration-core). This correction causes Hugh a certain level of worry and discomfort, as it raises complex questions of how the healing and regeneration process actually occurs, and how it determines what is and is not a flaw.

Hugh later assists [Dan Shaw](/people/dan-shaw) and [Ward Shaw (The Sword)](/people/ward-shaw-the-sword) to prepare explosives in an attempt to destroy the [Regeneration Core](/entities/regeneration-core).

**Traits:** Well educated, scientific background. Inquisitive, seeks answers to problems through rational analysis of facts.
