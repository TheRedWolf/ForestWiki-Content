Danny is a teenager, approximately 18-19 years old and is the de facto leader of the group of children encountered by [Cristina Thompson](/people/cristina-thompson) in The Portal in the Forest. Like many of the other children, his hometown is based in Richmond, Virginia.

Danny assisted [Cristina Thompson](/people/cristina-thompson) multiple times when trying to dispose of the [Soul Reader (Book)](/devices/soul-reader-book), and even went so far as to steal it to attempt to dispose of it on his own despite hitting [Thomas](/people/thomas) for trying to do the same thing. He subsequently learned, along with the other children, that the [Soul Reader (Book)](/devices/soul-reader-book) was not a malicious entity, and simply a device disguised as a book.

Danny suffered extreme brain damage due to observing the undisguised structure of the [Soul Reader (Book)](/devices/soul-reader-book), which was subsequently undone by the [Regret Demon](/entities/regret-demon) as part of a deal by [Cristina Thompson](/people/cristina-thompson) to leave its realm with the [Soul Reader (Book)](/devices/soul-reader-book) without opening/activating it.

After the loss of [Cristina Thompson](/people/cristina-thompson) through a portal to [The First World](/worlds/the-first-world), he became the [Soul Reader (Book)](/devices/soul-reader-book)'s primary user, using it to read both [Heath](/people/heath)'s and [Conn Thompson](/people/conn-thompson)'s souls.

Danny's current situation is unknown, however he has previously been in charge of a group of nearly a hundred people including [Alek](/people/alek-staley), [Thomas](/people/thomas), [Conn Thompson](/people/conn-thompson), [Jay](/people/jay) and many others, who were working along with [Heath](/people/heath) to stop [The Crushing Fist](/entities/the-crushing-fist) and rescue the missing [Brownshirts](/entities/brownshirt) and [Cristina Thompson](/people/cristina-thompson).

**Traits:**
- Natural leader of the group of children who discovered the portal in the forest.
- Stubborn, headstrong and brave, to the point of taking dangerous risks to avoid potential risk to others.
