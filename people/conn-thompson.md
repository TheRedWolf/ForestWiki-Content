# Conn Thompson

*First referenced:*

'I was told that everyone I'd served with in the military died shortly after I left.'

Conn Thompson was an ex-soldier, turned bodyguard, who was based on [The First World](/worlds/the-first-world) prior to its destruction. Believing his squad mates to have died after he left the service, he encountered [Higgins](/people/higgins), one of his ex-squadmates, which spurred him to begin investigating the lies told regarding their demise, and the mystery of their survival.

Thompson was employed by [Ethan](/people/ethan), a rich and influential individual who offered to get him back into the military if he so desired. [Ethan](/people/ethan) was successful, in a way, as Conn Thompson was reactivated and given new orders prior to entering a portal in a [Portal hub facility](/devices/portal-hub-facility) on [The First World](/worlds/the-first-world). These orders later turned out to be fake, and Conn Thompson was effectively exiled from [The First World](/worlds/the-first-world) for asking difficult questions.

He subsequently encountered his wife [Cristina Thompson](/people/cristina-thompson) in [Teskoy Prison](/entities/teskoy-prison) while attempting to kill [Ward Shaw (The Sword)](/people/ward-shaw-the-sword) for what he had purportedly done during the encounter with [The Ink](/entities/the-ink) on [Earth 44](/worlds/earth-44).

From his incarceration on [Teskoy Prison](/entities/teskoy-prison) to his subsequent escape after the destruction of [The First World](/worlds/the-first-world), Conn teamed up with [The Council](/entities/the-council), [Danny](/people/danny) and [Thomas](/people/thomas) to fight [The Crushing Fist](/entities/the-crushing-fist), culminating in [The Battle of the Capital Temple](/events/the-battle-of-the-capital-temple). While Conn did not participate in the assault on the [Capital Temple](/entities/capital-temple), he instead chose to stay with [Cristina Thompson](/people/cristina-thompson) and one of [Noah Fulmer](/people/noah-fulmer)'s iterations to Noah's home universe, where the [Quantum Duplication Rift/cleft](/entities/quantum-duplication-rift-cleft) was used to create thousands of copies of both Noah and some heavy weaponry and armor. Conn then separated from Cristina and the Noah army and engaged the [Preacher](/entities/preacher), which had stolen [Laura Thompson](/people/laura-thompson)'s body and soul from the graveyard in which she was interred.

After a lengthy chase and melee with the [Preacher](/entities/preacher), Conn apparently succeeded in stranding the [Preacher](/entities/preacher) in the universe inhabited by one of the desolate guardians capable of firing every nuclear device on the planet simultaneously. Conn then self-terminated using a [Gemstone Hegemony](/entities/gemstone-hegemony) [Amethyst Suicide Device](/devices/amethyst-suicide-device), leaving the [Preacher](/entities/preacher) to die from radiation damage, as the guardian had succeeded in launching all of the nuclear devices of his world.

**Traits:**
- Ex-military, provides security and bodyguard services.
- Not born in [The First World](/worlds/the-first-world), but married into it by marrying [Cristina Thompson](/people/cristina-thompson).
