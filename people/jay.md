Our Final Acts

Jay is the de facto leader of a group of caretaker survivors from the same reality [Noah Fulmer](/people/noah-fulmer) originates from. He was working with [Roger](/people/roger) and a number of other caretakers of the world, which was shattered by dimensional fractures brought on by a combination of [The Crushing Fist](/entities/the-crushing-fist) and their relative proximity to [Jonathan Cortin](/people/jonathan-cortin)'s reality. He was subsequently captured and subjected to collective psychic interrogation by [The Black-eyed Army](/people/the-black-eyed-army). Jay has worked with [Heath](/people/heath) while trying to combat the effects of dimensional fracture, such as [Purple Slice](/entities/purple-slice), the [Silver Nooses](/entities/silver-nooses) and the [Living Gas Entity](/entities/living-gas-entity).

Jay later teamed up with [Danny](/people/danny), [Conn Thompson](/people/conn-thompson), [Alek](/people/alek-staley) and others in an effort to help survivors of lost worlds and combat [The Crushing Fist](/entities/the-crushing-fist).

Jay has two daughters (Madison and Chloe), which is why he remained as a caretaker for his world.

Jay was part of the volunteer assault force attacking [The Black-eyed Army](/people/the-black-eyed-army) during [The Battle of the Capital Temple](/events/the-battle-of-the-capital-temple), and subsequently became one of many assisting in amputating the [GLORWOC](/entities/glorwoc) infected leg of the [Mictlan](/entities/mictlan), as well as the infected portion of [Animal Shadow](/entities/animal-shadow) flesh. He subsequently escaped the [Capital Temple](/entities/capital-temple) with the assistance of the [Shadow Entities](/entities/shadow-entities) and landed within a farm reality.

Jay survived the events of [The Crushing Fist](/entities/the-crushing-fist), as did Madison, Chloe and his wife. They have since returned to their home reality as part of a controlled exodus, escorted by [Ward Shaw](/people/ward-shaw-the-sword) and other members of [The Black-eyed Army](/people/the-black-eyed-army), along with [Noah Fulmer](/people/noah-fulmer).
