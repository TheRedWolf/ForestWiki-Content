# Thomas

*First referenced:*

The Portal in the Forest

Described as a lanky bespectacled boy in his early teens, Thomas is one of the children in the community first encountered by [Cristina Thompson](/people/cristina-thompson). While his precise background is largely unknown, the [Soul Reader (Book)](/devices/soul-reader-book) revealed that he is actually a [Brownshirt](/entities/brownshirt), a descended being of pure energy disguised in a biological human form. He also claims to have a big sister who went to war, and returned in a similar mental state to [Cristina Thompson](/people/cristina-thompson). His mother, another [Brownshirt](/entities/brownshirt), is apparently deceased. Prior to his descent to a biological lifeform, he had a number of siblings.

Initially a shy boy with no apparent friends, Thomas became a proper part of the group after accompanying [Cristina Thompson](/people/cristina-thompson) to a version of Earth filled with hostile [Corpse-things](/entities/corpse-thing) and successfully escaping subsequently. He assisted in training a first generation [iWorker](/devices/iworker) device in an attempt to dispose of the [Soul Reader (Book)](/devices/soul-reader-book), and also apparently got in a fight with another older boy, [Danny](/people/danny), by trying to take the [Soul Reader (Book)](/devices/soul-reader-book) to a dangerous universe on his own.

**Traits and abilities:**
- Despite being apparently biologically human, Thomas (like his [Brownshirt](/entities/brownshirt) brethren) can detect and interpret electromagnetic fields and signals to some extent.
- He is also capable of generating inter-dimensional [Portals](/devices/portal), however by his own admission is not very good at it, likely due to his young age and inexperience.
