# Vasiliev Blaku

*First Referenced:*

'I was told that everyone I'd served with in the military died shortly after I left.'

Vasiliev Blaku is a previous member of [The First World](/worlds/the-first-world) military force generally known as [Command](/entities/command). He was stationed on [Earth 44](/worlds/earth-44) and participated in an engagement with the entities within [The Ink](/entities/the-ink), including the [Mirror Octopus](/entities/mirror-octopus), [Preacher](/entities/preacher) and [Neural Mosquitos](/entities/neural-mosquito).

Due to the brutality of [The Sword](/people/ward-shaw-the-sword) in his pursuit of the [Preacher](/entities/preacher) within [The Ink](/entities/the-ink), as well as his very high casualty rate, Vasiliev Blaku plotted to kill [The Sword](/people/ward-shaw-the-sword). His attack on [The Sword](/people/ward-shaw-the-sword) was foiled by [Cristina Thompson](/people/cristina-thompson), whom Blaku suspected was going to tell [The Sword](/people/ward-shaw-the-sword) of their plan, and he was subsequently sent to [Teskoy Prison](/entities/teskoy-prison) for her purported murder during the coup attempt.

He is described as being a prankster, a fool and a clown by [Conn Thompson](/people/conn-thompson).

While escaping the destruction of the [Teskoy Prison](/entities/teskoy-prison) gateway facility due to the detonation of its failsafe explosives, Blaku was last seen attempting to access a helijet in the helijet bay. He survived, and was subsequently captured and brought to [The First World](/worlds/the-first-world) for imprisonment in a traditional prison along with [The Sword](/people/ward-shaw-the-sword), [Cristina Thompson](/people/cristina-thompson) and [Conn Thompson](/people/conn-thompson).

During the trial, Vasiliev discovered that [Cristina Thompson](/people/cristina-thompson) was responsible for the horrors he experienced on [Earth 44](/worlds/earth-44), and subsequently forgave [The Sword](/people/ward-shaw-the-sword). Although angry with Cristina for what happened, he volunteered to fly a helijet as close as possible to the [White Hole](/entities/white-hole) destroying [The First World](/worlds/the-first-world) and drop a [Dimensional Fracture Bomb](/devices/dimensional-fracture-bomb) to try and fracture the [Inner Shield](/entities/inner-shield) and disperse the compressive forces of [The Crushing Fist](/entities/the-crushing-fist). Another soldier accompanied him, and while the detonation was successful, [Heath](/people/heath) lost radar tracking on their helijet. The status of Vasiliev and the soldier who accompanied him is unknown.

**Traits:**
- Described as a prankster and a clown.
- Suffered psychological damage due to his engagements in [The Ink](/entities/the-ink).
- Previously held a grudge against [Ward Shaw (The Sword)](/people/ward-shaw-the-sword), but later transferred the grudge to [Cristina Thompson](/people/cristina-thompson).
- Subsequently demonstrated a heroic side through self sacrifice to deliver a [Dimensional Fracture Bomb](/devices/dimensional-fracture-bomb) to the [White Hole](/entities/white-hole) on [The First World](/worlds/the-first-world).
