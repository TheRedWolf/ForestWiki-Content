# Laura Thompson

*First Referenced (By Name):*

'I was told that everyone I'd served with in the military died shortly after I left. (Part 4)'

Laura Thompson was the daughter of [Cristina Thompson](/people/cristina-thompson) and [Conn Thompson](/people/conn-thompson), who was lost and believed deceased. [Cristina Thompson](/people/cristina-thompson) has encountered multiple copies of Laura in different realities, many of which were either deceased or damaged in some way. Some examples of these are in the [iWorker](/devices/iworker) reality, where a partially reprogrammed but living Laura was present, and on the fractured world of [Jonathan Cortin](/people/jonathan-cortin), where [Cristina Thompson](/people/cristina-thompson) found the body of Laura along with many others in a trench.

The current status of [The First World](/worlds/the-first-world) variant of Laura is known to be deceased, with her body and soul originally stolen by the [Preacher](/entities/preacher). As [Conn Thompson](/people/conn-thompson) has since destroyed the [Preacher](/entities/preacher), she is currently expected to be deceased.
