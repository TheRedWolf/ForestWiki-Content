# Ethan

*First Referenced:*

'I was told that everyone I'd served with in the military died shortly after I left.'

Ethan is a client of [Conn Thompson](/people/conn-thompson), who has provided bodyguard services for a number of years since leaving the military. He is rich and carries some influence in military and political circles as he is able to successfully get [Conn Thompson](/people/conn-thompson) back into the military at short notice. He is 25 years old and also drives a red Lamborghini.

He provided [Conn Thompson](/people/conn-thompson) with a cigar prior to him being exiled from [The First World](/worlds/the-first-world), which contained a metal chip similar to that given to [Alek](/people/alek-staley) by the [Brownshirts](/entities/brownshirt). While this may have been in return for [Conn Thompson](/people/conn-thompson) helping him handle an issue with his mother, it would appear he has ulterior motives, as he has continued to assist [Conn Thompson](/people/conn-thompson) even after his return to [The First World](/worlds/the-first-world) from [Teskoy Prison](/entities/teskoy-prison) and exile, and unlike the typical residents of [The First World](/worlds/the-first-world), he does appear to be concerned with [The Crushing Fist](/entities/the-crushing-fist) and the survival of the people outside the [Inner Shield](/entities/inner-shield).

Ethan was able to successfully escape [The First World](/worlds/the-first-world) prior to its destruction. Thanks to his assistance and willingness to try to help fight [The Crushing Fist](/entities/the-crushing-fist) rather than succumb to apathy like so many other inhabitants of [The First World](/worlds/the-first-world), [Conn Thompson](/people/conn-thompson) now considers Ethan to be a friend, calling him "Buddy".

**Traits:**
- Rich and influential, also smokes cigars.
- Associates with other rich and influential individuals.
- Initially described as an asshole by [Conn Thompson](/people/conn-thompson), his bodyguard.
- Does not demonstrate the typical apathetic traits of an inhabitant of [The First World](/worlds/the-first-world), demonstrating his willingness to try and help fight [The Crushing Fist](/entities/the-crushing-fist) where possible.
