# Roger

*First referenced:*

'I think I may have somehow missed the end of the world...' (Part 2)

Roger first encountered [Noah Fulmer](/people/noah-fulmer) while undergoing a group psychic interrogation by an unknown party. He is an ex-lawyer who has since become a garbage collector.

From Roger's perspective, he first encountered the left path copy of [Noah Fulmer](/people/noah-fulmer) who was searching for other people in his seemingly empty world. In his first encounter with [Noah Fulmer](/people/noah-fulmer), he reacted to being briefly fooled by pulling a gun and attempting to kill him in response to his attempts to gather information.

He subsequently assisted [Jay](/people/jay) and a number of other survivors in temporarily capturing the left path copy of [Noah Fulmer](/people/noah-fulmer) and attempting to escort him to the hunter personality of the right path copy. He was then kidnapped and tortured by the left path copy of [Noah Fulmer](/people/noah-fulmer) in an attempt to gather further information.

After the end of the psychic interrogation through the efforts of the [Shadow Entity](/entities/shadow-entity), Roger, [Jay](/people/jay) and a number of others were freed, and met up with the group of children from the forest (including [Thomas](/people/thomas)), who were preparing to rescue [Cristina Thompson](/people/cristina-thompson).

**Traits:**
- Standard human survivor of a dimensionally fractured universe.
- No unusual features, apart from suspicion born out of his experiences post-fracture event.
