# The Council

*First Referenced:*

Our Final Acts [Part 1]

The Council is a de facto leadership group, comprising [Alek](/people/alek-staley), [Danny](/people/danny), [Conn Thompson](/people/conn-thompson) and various others who have each become leaders in fighting [The Crushing Fist](/entities/the-crushing-fist). Many have become leaders through circumstance rather than through privilege. The Council's primary aim is to care for the hundreds of billions of refugees that have fled inwards towards [The First World](/worlds/the-first-world), as well as many other refugees from [The First World](/worlds/the-first-world) itself, after it was destroyed.

In addition to the humanitarian operations, The Council is also working to locate the shield generators that are creating and maintaining the [Inner Shield](/entities/inner-shield) and [Outer Shield](/entities/outer-shield). Due to a lack of resources, they have let the forces of [The Black-eyed Army](/people/the-black-eyed-army) work to locate the generators, planning to try and beat them to the shield generators once they have been found.
