Our Final Acts [Part 1]

Ashley was first encountered on the same Earth as [Alek](/people/alek-staley), and was previously in a relationship with [Alek](/people/alek-staley)'s neighbour, Dean. After the rise of the [Dreamer On High](/entities/dreamer-on-high), Ashley started dating [Alek](/people/alek-staley), and attempted to get him to look at the burning moon, in order for him to fall under the control of the [Dreamer On High](/entities/dreamer-on-high). When [Alek](/people/alek-staley) discovered this, she then successfully attracted the attention of bystanders, who attacked him.

After the destruction of the [Dreamer On High](/entities/dreamer-on-high), Ashley continued to date [Alek](/people/alek-staley), subsequently escaping with him and many other refugees towards [The First World](/worlds/the-first-world) in an attempt to seek shelter from [The Crushing Fist](/entities/the-crushing-fist).

Ashley is described by [Alek](/people/alek-staley) as being thin, blonde and pretty.

**Traits:**
- Shares similar interests to [Alek](/people/alek-staley), but is more extroverted.
- Shows a manipulative side, although this may have been exacerbated by the effects of the [Dreamer On High](/entities/dreamer-on-high).
