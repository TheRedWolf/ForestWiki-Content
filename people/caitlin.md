Caitlin is a childhood friend of [Chris](/people/chris) and [Noah Fulmer](/people/noah-fulmer), willingly participating in many of the supernatural events they experienced in their early years.

Caitlin was originally described as the 'token weird girl' of the group of outcasts [Noah Fulmer](/people/noah-fulmer) had as friends. Unlike [Chris](/people/chris), she willingly joined [Noah Fulmer](/people/noah-fulmer) in his investigating unusual phenomenon that he sensed.

Unlike both [Noah Fulmer](/people/noah-fulmer) and [Chris](/people/chris), Caitlin had a better social experience during highschool, dating [Josh](/people/josh), a soccer player, prior to dating [Chris](/people/chris) some time later.

While investigating an entity that was living near a phenomenon later identified as a [Quantum Duplication Rift/cleft](/devices/quantum-duplication-rift-cleft), Caitlin, along with [Chris](/people/chris) and [Noah Fulmer](/people/noah-fulmer) was duplicated by the rift. The duplicates were captured by a large carnivorous entity, and left to their fate. The fates of both the original Caitlin as well as her duplicate remains unknown.

**Traits:** Curious and adventurous, with a willingness to take risks. In early life considered a social outcast prone to picking her nose, although subsequently matured.
