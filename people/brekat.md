# Bre'kat

*First Referenced:*

The New Exodus Vanguard (Part 1)

The Bre'kat is the name given to former members of [The Black-eyed Army](/people/the-black-eyed-army). The Bre'kat are shadow augmented humans, altered by the effects of the [Shadow Entities](/entities/shadow-entities).

The name "Bre'kat" developed after [The Crushing Fist](/entities/the-crushing-fist) was stopped by [Cristina Thompson](/people/cristina-thompson), apparently at random. While none of the Bre'kat themselves have shown any positive or negative opinions of the new name, it has spread and is now commonly used by survivors of [The Crushing Fist](/entities/the-crushing-fist).

**Traits:**
- See [The Black-eyed Army](/people/the-black-eyed-army)
