The Contaminator is an individual who previously served as a desolate guardian in a world that had been consumed by [GLORWOC](/entities/glorwoc). While his original name is unknown, his name as The Contaminator referred to his condition of being infected by [GLORWOC](/entities/glorwoc), which he had staved off through exposure to freezing temperatures on a mountain.

While originally provisioned with many books (214 to be precise) to help ease his loneliness, he was unable to read them due to his hyperopia (farsightedness). When met by [Cristina Thompson](/people/cristina-thompson), he treated her as a hallucination, calling her Lundvik. After explaining what had happened to his world due to [GLORWOC](/entities/glorwoc), [Cristina Thompson](/people/cristina-thompson) left him a large supply of cheap glasses in order to read the books he had in his provisions.

During the events of [The Battle of the Capital Temple](/timelines/chronology-of-events-the-battle-of-the-capital-temple), the now delirious individual stumbled through cracks in his reality, infecting various other realities with [GLORWOC](/entities/glorwoc) before stumbling through another crack to the [Capital Temple](/entities/capital-temple) and collapsing there, infecting the pocket reality with [GLORWOC](/entities/glorwoc) as well.

**Traits:** Hyperopic, able to see for long distances as a result. Entirely infected by [GLORWOC](/entities/glorwoc), which has resulted in delirium and constant pain, and the dissolution of his skin and wasting of his body.
