Rothman was a member of the military of [The First World](/worlds/the-first-world/) ([Command](/unknown/command/)), serving under Brigadier-General [Ward Shaw (The Sword)](/people/ward-shaw-the-sword/) on [Earth 44](/worlds/earth-44/). During the revolt lead by [Vasiliev Blaku](/people/vasiliev-blaku/) he proceeded through [The Ink](/unknown/the-ink/) and into a [Shadow Sphere](/entities/shadow-sphere/), which resulted in his transformation into a member of [The Black-eyed Army](/people/the-black-eyed-army/).

Similar to [Sorkis](/people/sorkis/), he participated in [The Battle of the Capital Temple](/timelines/chronology-of-events-the-battle-of-the-capital-temple/), utilizing an [Emerald Spatial Displacer](/devices/emerald-spatial-displacer/) to great effect in killing attacking members of the volunteer assault force. He met his demise through a fight with [Noah Fulmer](/people/noah-fulmer/), who was able to detect and preempt the temporal and spatial displacements he was using during the battle, which caused him to be wounded sufficiently for the volunteer assault force to tear him to pieces in an effort to prevent his regeneration.

During his death, Rothman was able to recover his humanity (similar to [Sorkis](/people/sorkis/)), feeling a deep remorse for his actions as a member of [The Black-eyed Army](/people/the-black-eyed-army/) and a powerful longing for those he had lost.

**Traits:** Physically intimidating and powerful due to the effects of the [Shadow Sphere](/entities/shadow-sphere/). Effective soldier, and prepared to follow orders. Vicious fighter when in battle.
