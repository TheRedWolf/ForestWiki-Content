'I was told that everyone I'd served with in the military died shortly after I left.'

Described as being small, metallic and square in shape, these metallic chips appear to contain various delicate engravings. They were being carried by the [Brownshirt](/races/brownshirt/) refugees, who were carrying multiple chips while escaping their pursuers. So far, a chip has been left with [Alek](/people/alek-staley/), recovered from [Cordyceps Fungus](/entities/cordyceps-fungus/) infested [Brownshirts](/races/brownshirt/) by [Cristina Thompson](/people/cristina-thompson/), and given to [Conn Thompson](/people/conn-thompson/) by [Ethan](/people/ethan/), who hid one inside a cigar. Where [Ethan](/people/ethan/) acquired his chip is unknown at this point.

The [Brownshirts](/races/brownshirt/) have advised the chips will help show the way to a safe haven.

The chips appear to have originated in [The First World](/worlds/the-first-world/), where they act as both a compass and access key to pass the inner shield. [Thomas](/people/thomas/) and the other [Brownshirts](/races/brownshirt/) are able to track the signature of such chips in order to open portals near their physical location. In addition, the chips are able to be manipulated to generate differing signals, as done by [Cristina Thompson](/people/cristina-thompson/) while on the Earth of [Teskoy Prison](/devices/teskoy-prison/).
