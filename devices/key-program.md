# Key Program

**First Referenced:**

'I think I may have somehow missed the end of the world... (various parts)'

The Key Program appears to be a software component of a larger mechanism capable of affecting the structure of a given universe. 
Described as dangerous but unable to crack the wall of a reality on its own by [Noah Fulmer](/people/noah-fulmer/). The Key Program also appears to be a sentient piece of technology, created through a [Brownshirt](/races/brownshirt/) volunteer who permanently modified his own form in order to perform a very specific task related to the shield structure. He has previously known and worked with [Heath](/people/heath/) (although [Heath](/people/heath/) doesn't remember), describing him as 'Helpful Human Heath'.

The Key Program will perform his task when taken to the main [Capital Temple](/devices/capital-temple/). Little else is known of the nature of the Key Program, other than it being collected by [Noah Fulmer](/people/noah-fulmer/) based on information provided by [Heath](/people/heath/), and initially stored on his phone.
