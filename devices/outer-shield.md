'I was told that everyone I'd served with in the military died shortly after I left.'

The Outer Shield is a vast structure, encompassing many different realities that are (or were) populated by humans. The Outer Shield requires constant monitoring and maintenance to ensure its stability, otherwise cracks and rifts can form which allow dangerous entities to enter human populated universes. This maintenance is the responsibility of [Command](/people/command/), which appears to have abandoned its task for reasons unknown. As a result, the Outer Shield has cracked in numerous places, allowing [Sentient Flame](/entities/sentient-flame/) to enter, along with innumerable malicious entities.

The Outer Shield, along with the [Inner Shield](/devices/inner-shield/) and [Branch Worlds](/worlds/branch-world/) were constructed with the assistance of the [Brownshirts](/races/brownshirt/), who helped [The First World](/worlds/the-first-world/) when it was a new power in the multiverse. It is generated by the [Capital Temple](/devices/capital-temple/), which exists in its own pocket universe.
