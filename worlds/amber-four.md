Amber Four was one of the original ten [Branch Worlds](/worlds/branch-world/) created as part of the shield structure built by [The First World](/worlds/the-first-world/) and the [Brownshirts](/races/brownshirt/). Prior to its destruction, Amber Four was used to try and strengthen the [Outer Shield](/devices/outer-shield/) protecting the human populated section of the multiverse. Amber Four was completely obliterated due to the overloading of its shield generation systems, which exploded as a result. [Danny](/people/danny/) noted in shock that the entire planet was gone due to the explosion.
