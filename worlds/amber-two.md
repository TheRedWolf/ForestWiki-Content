Amber Two is one of the original ten [Branch Worlds](/worlds/branch-world/) created as part of the shield structure built by [The First World](/worlds/the-first-world/) and the [Brownshirts](/races/brownshirt/). While it was presumed destroyed through the actions of [Cristina Thompson](/people/cristina-thompson/), it has since been encountered by [The New Exodus Vanguard](/people/the-new-exodus-vanguard/).

While the exact motivations of the population of Amber Two are unknown, they have hidden their previous status as a branch world and are deeply distrustful of outsiders, being quite prepared to kill anyone who might reveal their existence to outsiders or remnants of [The First World](/worlds/the-first-world/). Some of the more extreme elements of Amber Two's population also pursued [Kendrick Merrill's](/people/kendrick-merrill/) team into the multiverse in an attempt to prevent them telling others of their discovery.

[Lian Yen](/people/lian-yen/) experienced this xenophobia first hand when secretly mingling with the general population, and suffered significant injuries as a result.

The exact status of Amber Two is unknown, as incursions from the [Gemstone Hegemony](/unknown/gemstone-hegemony/) and other threats from the multiverse appear to be an ongoing issue.
