Amber Eight was one of the original ten [Branch Worlds](/worlds/branch-world/) created as part of the shield structure built by [The First World](/worlds/the-first-world/) and the [Brownshirts](/races/brownshirt/). Prior to its destruction, it participated in the effort to stave off [The Crushing Fist](/unknown/the-crushing-fist/) by reinforcing the [Outer Shield](/devices/outer-shield/). During the effort its shield generation system was overloaded to the point it exploded, shattering the planet and rupturing it entirely in two.
