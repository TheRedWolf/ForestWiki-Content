# Amber One

**First Referenced:**

Our Final Acts (Final Part)


Amber One was one of the original ten [Branch Worlds](/worlds/branch-world/) created as part of the shield structure built by [The First World](/worlds/the-first-world/) and the [Brownshirts](/races/brownshirt/). Prior to its presumed destruction, Amber One contained approximately seven billion inhabitants, all descended from the original 50,000 population work crew that were left behind to maintain the system when the shield was first constructed.

Amber One was used by [Cristina Thompson](/people/cristina-thompson/) as her base of operations when attempting to battle the final collapse of [The Crushing Fist](/unknown/the-crushing-fist/). It was subsequently thought to be destroyed along with all its inhabitants when it was used as a magnet to draw away [Inter-reality Dust](/unknown/inter-reality-dust/) from the [Outer Shield](/devices/outer-shield/), however it has since transpired that many of the [Branch Worlds](/worlds/branch-world/) appear to have survived and been launched deep into the multiverse through a phenomenon similar to a surface-tension catapult.
