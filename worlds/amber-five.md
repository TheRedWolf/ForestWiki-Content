Our Final Acts (Part 3)


Amber Five is a parallel version of Earth, enclosed within its own local shield in a fashion similar to [The First World](/worlds/the-first-world/). It was one of a number of [Branch Worlds](/worlds/branch-world/) grown in the creation of the [Inner Shield](/devices/inner-shield/) and [Outer Shield](/devices/outer-shield/) mechanisms by the inhabitants of [The First World](/worlds/the-first-world/) and the [Brownshirts](/races/brownshirt/).

The shield of Amber Five suffered a partial failure due to the compression of [The Crushing Fist](/unknown/the-crushing-fist/), resulting in leaking radio and television transmissions originating from within the shield. [Alek](/people/alek-staley/) and a volunteer detachment travelled to Amber Five via [Earth 44](/worlds/earth-44), but found that the [Mictlan](/entities/corpse-thing/) and other dangerous entities had already arrived and devastated the local population.

[Alek](/people/alek-staley/) successfully negotiated with the [Mictlan](/entities/corpse-thing/) in an effort to reach the backup shield generator facilities housed on the [Branch World](/worlds/branch-world/), as well as convincing it to join [The Battle of the Capital Temple](/timelines/chronology-of-events-the-battle-of-the-capital-temple/).

During the final stages of [The Crushing Fist](/unknown/the-crushing-fist/), [Alek](/people/alek-staley/) and a number of others assisted in attempting to strengthen the [Outer Shield](/devices/outer-shield/), prior to their evacuation.

Amber Five was presumed destroyed with all remaining population not killed by the [Mictlan](/entities/corpse-thing/) when it was used as a magnet to draw [Inter-reality Dust](/unknown/inter-reality-dust/) away from the [Outer Shield](/devices/outer-shield/). It has however since transpired that the [Branch Worlds](/worlds/branch-world/) not destroyed outright during [The Crushing Fist](/unknown/the-crushing-fist/) have likely survived being used to draw off the [Inter-reality Dust](/unknown/inter-reality-dust/) due to the way their shields collapsed under the pressure.
