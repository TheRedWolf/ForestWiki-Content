# Chronology of Events - The Author (AKA Noah Fulmer)

## Early Life

Originally grew up in Virginia.

Moved to American Midwest (Ohio) from the East Coast near the Appalachian Mountains (Virginia) at some point during early teenage years.

Age: Approximately 14 years old

Encountered spectral or ghost-like entity in 'The House Beyond The Edge' with [Chris](/people/chris/) and [Caitlin](/people/caitlin/), as well as another german boy called Hans. As discovered by [Noah Fulmer](/people/noah-fulmer/), the spectral entity was only able to be perceived while the eyes were kept closed, which assisted the group in successfully escaping the area.

Approximately two years later, again with [Chris](/people/chris/) and [Caitlin](/people/caitlin/), encountered a number of [Bright-eyed Mimics](/entities/bright-eyed-mimic/) in 'The Gorge', which are capable of mimicry and are apparently carnivorous.

Age: Approximately 16 years old

Indeterminate length of time, no more than a few months after the events of 'The Gorge', [Noah Fulmer](/people/noah-fulmer/) utilized his abilities in detecting and tracking apparent supernatural phenomenon within his school. Successfully tracked entities in the school library, and a disheveled homeless man in the gymnasium. Developed rivalry with another classmate, [Josh](/people/josh/), due to his relationship with [Caitlin](/people/caitlin/).

Approximately two years later (approximate age 18 years old), [Noah Fulmer](/people/noah-fulmer/) was in the start of his eleventh grade at highschool, the events of 'Detour' took place. [Chris](/people/chris/) was now dating [Caitlin](/people/caitlin/), and [Noah Fulmer](/people/noah-fulmer/) was dating a girl called Nicole. After detecting a supernatural phenomenon while driving, the group found itself translocated hundreds of miles from their previous location in Ohio to Western Virginia, where they encountered multiple living corpse entities and a river-based creature that fed on animals stuck in the water.

Shortly after the events of 'Detour', [Noah Fulmer](/people/noah-fulmer/), [Chris](/people/chris/) and [Caitlin](/people/caitlin/) encountered the [Quantum Duplication Rift/cleft](/devices/quantum-duplication-rift-cleft/) and were duplicated by it. The doppelgangers, or left path copies of the group were captured by a spider-like entity which took them to a cave for later consumption. After being deliberately abandoned to their fate by the right path copies at the prompting of the right path copy of [Noah Fulmer](/people/noah-fulmer/), the left path copy of [Noah Fulmer](/people/noah-fulmer/) escaped his fate through unknown means. The status of the left path [Chris](/people/chris/) and [Caitlin](/people/caitlin/) is currently unknown.

## Later Life

Age: Unknown

First entered [The Back Paths](/devices/the-back-paths/) with [Mike](/people/mike/) in search of a lost seven year old girl. No clear indication whether this incident occurs for the left path or right path copy of [Noah Fulmer](/people/noah-fulmer/), but occurs after development of the 'Hunter' personality. Properly encounters parallel universes and [GLORWOC](/entities/glorwoc/) for the first time. After successfully escaping the entity inhabiting [The Back Paths](/devices/the-back-paths/) with the lost seven year old girl, [Noah Fulmer](/people/noah-fulmer/) discovers the missing child has already been found, and suspects the child found in [The Back Paths](/devices/the-back-paths/) to be a non-human hostile entity. Whether it is actually non-human is currently unknown.

An unknown length of time later, starts conversing with [Heath](/people/heath/) during the events of 'The Desolate Guardians'. Communicates the reality of [Heath](/people/heath/)'s situation to him, but then backtracks after realizing the fear and pain it causes him.

Approximately a month after the events of 'The Desolate Guardians', the right path copy of [Noah Fulmer](/people/noah-fulmer/) has been undergoing a type of psychic or telepathic interrogation by unknown assailants, along with his left path doppelganger and a number of other people including [Jay](/people/jay/) and [Roger](/people/roger/). Released from this state by the [Shadow Entity](/entities/shadow-entity/), both copies of [Noah Fulmer](/people/noah-fulmer/) along with the rest of the people being interrogated subsequently teamed up with the children from 'The Portal in the Forest', including the [Brownshirt](/races/brownshirt/) [Thomas](/people/thomas/), in order to rescue [Cristina Thompson](/people/cristina-thompson/).

One variant of [Noah Fulmer](/people/noah-fulmer/) participated in a rescue attempt to rescue [Cristina Thompson](/people/cristina-thompson/) from [Teskoy Prison](/devices/teskoy-prison/). The activities of the other variant are largely unknown, apart from working with [Heath](/people/heath/) to establish a network link to [The First World](/worlds/the-first-world/). After attempting to rescue [Cristina Thompson](/people/cristina-thompson/) from [Teskoy Prison](/devices/teskoy-prison/), one variant of [Noah Fulmer](/people/noah-fulmer/) remained with [Cristina Thompson](/people/cristina-thompson/), [Conn Thompson](/people/conn-thompson/), [Vasiliev Blaku](/people/vasiliev-blaku/) and...

The second copy of [Noah Fulmer](/people/noah-fulmer/) left [The Council](/unknown/the-council/) to join [Conn Thompson](/people/conn-thompson/) and [Cristina Thompson](/people/cristina-thompson/) after her exile following the destruction of [The First World](/worlds/the-first-world/). He then duplicated himself using the [Quantum Duplication Rift/cleft](/devices/quantum-duplication-rift-cleft/) to create upwards of two thousand further duplicates, forming an army that traveled to each of the ten [Branch Worlds](/worlds/branch-world/).
