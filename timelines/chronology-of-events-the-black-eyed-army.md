# Chronology of Events - The Black-eyed Army

## Foundation

Encounter with the [Shadow Sphere](/entities/shadow-sphere/) within [The Ink](/unknown/the-ink/) on [Earth 44](/worlds/earth-44/) by military personnel of [Command](/unknown/command/)

Creation of [The Black-eyed Army](/people/the-black-eyed-army/) through traversal via the [Shadow Sphere](/entities/shadow-sphere/) to different realities. [The Sword](/people/the-sword/) was also affected by change, but was in part preserved through the presence of the [Purple bio-stone](/devices/purple-bio-stone/) which kept [Cristina Thompson](/people/cristina-thompson/) in control of his actions. The [Purple bio-stone](/devices/purple-bio-stone/) also allowed [The Black-eyed Army](/people/the-black-eyed-army/) to escape the entities that were torturing them.

Arrival on blood and bone reality.

Arrival of [Shadow Sphere](/entities/shadow-sphere/), triggered by rational thought of the members of [The Black-eyed Army](/people/the-black-eyed-army/)

Departure from blood and bone reality.

Travel through multiple realities via the [Shadow Sphere](/entities/shadow-sphere/). Return to human occupied space near the [Outer Shield](/devices/outer-shield/).

Collection of weapons, technology and exotic creatures determined to be useful and no longer a threat to their darkness-enhanced state. Kidnap and control of individuals with useful abilities.

Loss of [Ward Shaw (The Sword)](/people/ward-shaw-the-sword/) to capture by [The First World](/worlds/the-first-world/)

## Later Activities

Attack on outpost on a [Farming World](/worlds/farming-world/) in order to capture multiple [Brownshirts](/races/brownshirt/). Escaped via the [Shadow Sphere](/entities/shadow-sphere/) with multiple captives. Caused high casualties through use of gas to attempt knock-out and capture of [Brownshirts](/races/brownshirt/), as the gas killed normal humans.

Searching to find a way to access the generators powering the [Inner Shield](/devices/inner-shield/) and [Outer Shield](/devices/outer-shield/).

Movement of the [Brownshirt](/races/brownshirt/) captives, enroute to a shield generator location.

Participation in the battle of the [Capital Temple](/devices/capital-temple/). Heavy losses sustained.

Agreement to rejoin humanity as part of the alliance forged by [Danny](/people/danny/).

Withdrawl from the [Capital Temple](/devices/capital-temple/) with all other non-[GLORWOC](/entities/glorwoc/) infected individuals

Attachment to remaining human populations of [The Council](/unknown/the-council/), acting as defenders and guardians against the horrors of the multiverse, as well as trainers for [The New Exodus Vanguard](/people/the-new-exodus-vanguard/)
