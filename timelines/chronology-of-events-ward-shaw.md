# Chronology of Events - Ward Shaw (AKA The Sword)

## Pre-Military

Worked in construction.

First encountered the [Regeneration Core](/devices/regeneration-core/) after being shown what it could do by a colleague called Javier. The core had been buried under the Florida swamps for thousands of years, in a large cavern.

Second encounter with the [Regeneration Core](/devices/regeneration-core/), this time also with [Hugh](/people/hugh/). Took measurements of water, also discovered that contact with the water resulted in less body decay in the dream, signifying a stronger psychic connection with the dormant [Multiverse Titan](/entities/multiverse-titan/). Submerged completely in the water in the cavern in order to rescue a boy who fell in.

Third encounter with the [Regeneration Core](/devices/regeneration-core/), this time bringing both [Hugh](/people/hugh/) and [Ward Shaw (The Sword)](/people/ward-shaw-the-sword/)'s drug affected brother [Dan Shaw](/people/dan-shaw/) along. Discovery that the events of the psychic nightmare were due to occur on October 2nd, one week from their current day, and that all past people who had the dream had it in the same time period. Further discovery that the psychic nightmare caused by the [Regeneration Core](/devices/regeneration-core/) is actually the [Multiverse Titan](/entities/multiverse-titan/) regrowing itself by consuming and digesting the entire solar system.

Fourth encounter with the [Regeneration Core](/devices/regeneration-core/), although without indirectly accessing the psychic nightmare as in previous encounters. Exploration of the deep section of the cavern. First direct contact with the biological material created by the [Regeneration Core](/devices/regeneration-core/) and direct interaction with the psychic nightmare during an electrical flare from the [Regeneration Core](/devices/regeneration-core/). Discovery that ongoing exposure to the regenerative abilities of the [Regeneration Core](/devices/regeneration-core/) results in unusual levels of physical growth.

Fifth and final encounter with the [Regeneration Core](/devices/regeneration-core/). Discovery of its purpose and history, as well as the moment in which the [Multiverse Titan](/entities/multiverse-titan/) was able to connect and project the [Regeneration Core](/devices/regeneration-core/) to that particular universe. Destruction of the [Regeneration Core](/devices/regeneration-core/)
